# MCARaTS

This repository was created to do my homework given in the Atmospheric Radiation lecture.  
Source codes are provided by Iwabuch, H. (2016).  
This version is v0.10.3, downloaded from the [official website](https://sites.google.com/site/mcarats/monte-carlo-atmospheric-radiative-transfer-simulator-mcarats?authuser=0).  
Some parts of the code are rewritten by the owner of this repository for my purposes.
